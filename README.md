# Survey_data-cleaning-and-manipulation
I am excited to share that I recently completed my first data cleaning and manipulation project using Python and advanced Excel techniques!
Working with large datasets can be overwhelming, but I was able to break down the project into smaller tasks and utilize my knowledge of Python and advanced Excel to tackle each one efficiently.
I learned how to use Python's Pandas library to import, clean, and manipulate data, as well as how to use Excel's pivot tables and VLOOKUP function to analyze and present the data in a clear and concise manner.
I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and am looking forward to applying these skills to future data-related tasks. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey as a data enthusiast!

What did I learn?
- Importing and exporting data from various sources (e.g. CSV, Excel, SQL databases) using Pandas.
- Cleaning and preprocessing data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Manipulating data by selecting, filtering, and sorting rows and columns.
- Grouping and aggregating data using functions like groupby and pivot_table.
- Visualizing data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Advanced data manipulation techniques, such as merging and joining data sets, applying functions to data, and reshaping data.
